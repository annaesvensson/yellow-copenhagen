## How to customise a theme

All theme files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. All layout files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. You can edit these files. Your changes will not be overwritten when the website is updated.

**TODO:** *Describe how your extension can be adjusted. Write multiple howto sections, if necessary.*

## Installation

[Download extension](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-basic/archive/master.zip) and copy zip file into your `system/extensions` folder. Right click if you use Safari.

**TODO:** *Change the link to your own repository. Mention third party libraries and web services that you use.*

## Designer

**TODO:** *Make your own extension based on this example. Have a look inside your `system/extensions` folder, here are all extension files. You can edit the source code in `basic.php`, which takes care of changing the system settings. You can edit the language settings in `basic.txt`, which extends existing language settings.*

Example. [Get help](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/).

**TODO:** *Change the link to your own repository. Review your documentation from the perspective of the user. Users want to reach their goals and the documentation should help them do it. The main focus should be on people and their everyday life. Not on technical details.
