## Settings

The following files can be configured:

`system/themes/basic.css` = CSS file of the theme  
`system/themes/basic.png` = icon of the theme  

## Installation

[Download extension](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-basic/archive/master.zip) and copy zip file into your `system/extensions` folder. Right click if you use Safari.

**TODO:** *Change the link to your own repository. Mention third party libraries and web services that you use.*

## Designer

Example. [Get help](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-basic/issues).

Use this extension to make a new theme. Have a look inside your `system/extensions` folder, here are all extension files. You can edit the source code in `basic.php`, which changes the website's default theme. You can edit the language settings in `basic.txt`. Every repository has a file called `extension.ini` with extension settings.

**TODO:** *Change the link to your own repository. Review your extension from the perspective of the user. Users want to reach their goals and the documentation should help them do it. The main focus should be on people and their everyday life. Not on technical details.
